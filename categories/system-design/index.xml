      <description>Major Indian languages lend themselves to natural unification due to their common phonetic structure but only differ in visual appearances. Our languages are arranged in a logical pattern by the 5th-century scholar Panini based on vibrations and sounds from the different parts of the mouth with the distinction of vowels and consonants in an orderly manner, unlike the English alphabets.
The only ambiguity lies in the mismatch of sounds and shapes of the fonts.</description>

      <description>India&amp;rsquo;s inhibitions about discussing sex get surfaced when a condom ad appears on TV and everyone in the family pretends not to notice anything. Sex is an awkward topic, even for the most educated people in our country and that is not okay.
As a result of this reticence, kids don&amp;rsquo;t learn about sex from their parents but from porn, which creates an unhealthy, unrealistic impression of sex in their minds.</description>
