      <description>In an age where technology is becoming so flexible that we can make sense out of languages on a mathematical level and use the structure to create meaningful applications, keeping languages agile and technology-compatible is a necessity.
What a shame that rich languages like Sanskrit have no smart way of learning like Duolingo or Memrise. It isn&amp;rsquo;t just language learning which is hampered because of lack of digitization but also a large section of our society cannot access to the wealth of information internet has to offer.</description>
